Power Simulation Codes:
You are supposed to get a TLE to run the code for. Keep a note for the date present in the TLE. Make Appropriate changes in constants_v15.m and sun_calc.m
Use the TLE in store TLE in TLE.txt and run TLE2Orbit.m
Copy Paste parameters from TLE2Orbit.m to getOrbitdata.m and run it. This creates the SGP_120k.
Run Constants_v15 then sun_calc then light_calc and then Energy_for_ideal_orbit.m 
Change the Areas in constant_v15.m
